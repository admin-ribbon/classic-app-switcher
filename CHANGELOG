- Updated Release for GNOME Shell 47, 48 & 49

### Added

- Panel Button Idle-State UI/UX Improvements

- **New Feature** Introducing optional Mac OS style keyboard shortcut support! (See Readme for full details)
- Bundled all UI Icons instead of relying on named-icon from active theme/system
- Extended support to include GNOME Shell 47

### Fixed

- Missing popup-menu max-width CSS styling
- Panel button padding increased to match system-status-icon when using icon-only mode
- Hard-coded panel-button width moved to CSS Style-sheet
- Missing gettext string translation on fallback Hide/Quit menu-items

### Removed

- GNOME Shell 50 support temporarily removed pending stable release due to upstream panel button event handling regression
