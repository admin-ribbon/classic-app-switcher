**Development:**

- AI assistance from Anthropic's Claude and xAI's Grok for code generation, debugging and general bantz & lolz 😆

**Built with:**
- GNOME Shell APIs (GPL-3.0)
- Standard extension patterns from GNOME Shell Extensions documentation

**Special Thanks:**
- The GNOME Shell development team for excellent documentation
- The folks at Infinite Mac (https://infinitemac.org/) for allowing me to relive those Classic Mac days via their web based virtualisation (Go SheepShaver! 🐑 Baaah)
